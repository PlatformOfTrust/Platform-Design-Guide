description: How to integrate an existing ontology to PoT Core Ontology

# Extending the ontology

First, the ontology to be integrated must be evaluated whether the integration is possible. Not all ontologies can be integrated with PoT Core Ontology. The logical models of the ontologies to be integrated should fit together.

If the ontology to be integrated is a new separate domain, integration is relatively easy. The more ontologies overlap with each other, the more difficult integration is.
